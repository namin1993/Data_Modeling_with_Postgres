## D497 Task 2 Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

### <u>Project Description:</u>
<p>In this project, a startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.</p> 
<p>We will create a Postgres database and tables to store data from 2 datasets. After that, we will create an ETL pipeline script from Python and SQL in order extract, transform, and load data from the directories that the datasets are stored into the tables. From the creation of the database, star-schema table structure, and ETL pipeline, the hypothetical Sparkify analytics team will be able to create optimized queries for songplay analysis.</p> 

### <u>Resources:</u>
The project workspace contains 1 README, 2 dataset files, 5 python or SQL script files, and 1 image directory containing the database schema PDF. The description of each dataset file and workstation file is listed below.

#### Dataset Files
<ul>
    <li>**Song Dataset:** The dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.</li>
    Example:
    """ 
    song_files = get_files("data/song_data")
    filepath = song_files[0]
    df = pd.read_json(filepath, dtype={'year': int}, lines=True)
    song_data = df[['song_id', 'title', 'artist_id', 'year', 'duration']].values[0].tolist()
    song_data   
    """
    """ ['SONHOTT12A8C13493C', 'Something Girls', 'AR7G5I41187FB4CE6C', 1982, 233.40363] """
    <li>**Log Dataset:** The dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.</li>
    Example:
    """
    log_files = get_files("data/log_data")
    filepath = log_files[0]
    df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)
    """
    """['Frumpies','Logged In','Anabelle','F', 0, 'Simpson', 134.47791, 'free', 'Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD', 'PUT', 'NextSong', 1541044398796.0, 455, 'Fuck Kitty', 200, 1541903636796, '"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.125 Safari/537.36"', '69'] """
</ul>

#### Workstation Files
<ul>
    <li>**README.md:** Provides discussion on your project.</li>
    <li>**create_tables.py:** Drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.</li>
    <li>**etl.py:** Reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.</li>
    <li>**etl.ipynb:** Reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.</li>
    <li>**sql_queries.py:** Contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.</li>
    <li>**test.ipynb:** Displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.</li>
</ul>

### <u>How to run:</u>
<ol>
    <li>In the terminal, run **create_tables.py** to connect to the database and create the tables: ''' python create_tables.py '''</li>
    <li>In the terminal, run **etl.py** for loading, extracting and inserting the data in to the tables: ''' python etl.py '''</li>
    <li>In Jupyter notebook, run **test.ipynb** to confirm the creation of database and columns.</li>
</ol>

### <u>Database Schema:</u>
The database will contain a star-schema of 1 fact table <i>songplays</i> and 4 dimensional tables for <i>users</i>, <i>songs</i>, <i>artists</i>, and <i>time</i>. Every primary key from the dimensional table is included in the fact table. There is a one-to-many relationship between each primary key from the dimensional table to the fact table. The fact table itself, <i>songplays</i>, contains its own primary key to identify each unique record.
